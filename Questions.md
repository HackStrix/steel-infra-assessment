What happens to a session if its worker crashes? — Should we try to recover or just kill and free up the worker.

Worker Spawn - static vs auto scale up and down based on load. 

Failure Handling - 
process crashes/dies - should we restart? or accept failure and move one
request timeout - should we kill and restart

what scale are we talking here? 
should I consider a horizontally scalable architecture? for instace
